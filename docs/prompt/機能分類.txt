A. Branch
To cause a flow (material, energy, signal) to no longer be joined or mixed.

1. Separate
    To isolate a flow (material, energy, signal) into distinct components.
    The separated components are distinct from the flow before separation, as well as each other.
    Example: A glass prism separates light into different wavelength components to produce a rainbow.

    i. Divide
    To separate a flow.
    Example: A vending machine divides the solid form of coins into appropriate denominations.

    ii. Extract
    To draw, or forcibly pull out, a flow.
    Example: A vacuum cleaner extracts debris from the imported mixture and exports clean air to the environment.

    iii. Remove
    To take away a part of a flow from its prefixed place.
    Example: A sander removes small pieces of the wood surface to smooth the wood.

2. Distribute
    To cause a flow (material, energy, signal) to break up.
    The individual bits are similar to each other and the undistributed flow.
    Example: An atomizer distributes (or sprays) hair-styling liquids over the head to hold the hair in the desired style.

B. Channel
To cause a flow (material, energy, signal) to move from one location to another location.

3. Import
    To bring in a flow (material, energy, signal) from outside the system boundary.
    Example: A physical opening at the top of a blender pitcher imports a solid (food) into the system. Also, a handle on the blender pitcher imports a human hand.

4. Export
    To send a flow (material, energy, signal) outside the system boundary.
    Example: Pouring blended food out of a standard blender pitcher exports liquid from the system. The opening at the top of the blender is a solution to the export sub-function.

5. Transfer
    To shift, or convey, a flow (material, energy, signal) from one place to another.

    i. Transport
    To move a material from one place to another.
    Example: A coffee maker transports liquid (water) from its reservoir through its heating chamber and then to the filter basket.

    ii. Transmit
    To move energy from one place to another.
    Example: In a hand-held power sander, the housing of the sander transmits human force to the object being sanded.

6. Guide
    To direct the course of a flow (material, energy, signal) along a specific path.
    Example: A domestic HVAC system guides gas (air) around the house to the correct locations via a set of ducts.

    i. Translate
    To fix the movement of a flow by a device into one linear direction.
    Example: In an assembly line, a conveyor belt translates partially completed products from one assembly station to another.

    ii. Rotate
    To fix the movement of a flow by a device around one axis.
    Example: A computer disk drive rotates the magnetic disks around an axis so that the head can read data.

    iii. Allow degree of freedom (DOF)
    To control the movement of a flow by a force external to the device into one or more directions.
    Example: To provide easy trunk access and close appropriately, trunk lids need to move along a specific degree of freedom. A four-bar linkage allows a rotational DOF for the trunk lid.

C. Connect
To bring two or more flows (material, energy, signal) together.

7. Couple
    To join or bring together flows (material, energy, signal) such that the members are still distinguishable from each other.
    Example: A standard pencil couples an eraser and a writing shaft. The coupling is performed using a metal sleeve that is crimped to the eraser and the shaft.

    i. Join
    To couple flows together in a predetermined manner.
    Example: A ratchet joins a socket on its square shaft interface.

    ii. Link
    To couple flows together by means of an intermediary flow.
    Example: A turnbuckle links two ends of a steering cable together.

8. Mix
    To combine two flows (material, energy, signal) into a single, uniform homogeneous mass.
    Example: A shaker mixes a paint base and its dyes to form a homogeneous liquid.

D. Control magnitude
To alter or govern the size or amplitude of a flow (material, energy, signal).

9.Actuate
    To commence the flow of energy, signal, or material in response to an imported control signal.
    Example: A circuit switch actuates the flow of electrical energy and turns on a light bulb.

10. Regulate
    To adjust the flow of energy, signal, or material in response to a control signal, such as a characteristic of a flow.
    Example: Turning the valves regulates the flow rate of the liquid flowing from a faucet.

    i. Increase
    To enlarge a flow in response to a control signal.
    Example: Opening the valve of a faucet further increases the flow of water.

    ii. Decrease
    To reduce a flow in response to a control signal.
    Example: Closing the valve further decreases the flow of propane to the gas grill.

11. Change
    To adjust the flow of energy, signal, or material in a predetermined and fixed manner.
    Example: In a hand-held drill, a variable resistor changes the electrical energy flow to the motor, thus changing the speed at which the drill turns.

    i. Increment
    To enlarge a flow in a predetermined and fixed manner.
    Example: A magnifying glass increments the visual signal (i.e., the print) from a paper document.

    ii. Decrement
    To reduce a flow in a predetermined and fixed manner.
    Example: The gear train of a power screwdriver decrements the flow of rotational energy.

    iii. Shape
    To mold or form a flow.
    Example: In the auto industry, large presses shape sheet metal into contoured surfaces that become fenders, hoods, and trunks.

    iv. Condition
    To render a flow appropriate for the desired use.
    Example: To prevent damage to electrical equipment, a surge protector conditions electrical energy by excluding spikes and noise (usually through capacitors) from the energy path.

12. Stop
    To cease, or prevent, the transfer of a flow (material, energy, signal).
    Example: A reflective coating on a window stops the transmission of UV radiation through a window.

    i. Prevent
    To keep a flow from happening.
    Example: A submerged gate on a dam wall prevents water from flowing to the other side.

    ii. Inhibit
    To significantly restrain a flow, though a portion of the flow continues to be transferred.
    Example: The structures of space vehicles inhibit the flow of radiation to protect crew and cargo.

E. Convert
To change from one form of a flow (material, energy, signal) to another.
For completeness, any type of flow conversion is valid. In practice, conversions such as converting electricity to torque will be more common than converting solid to optical energy.
Example: An electrical motor converts electricity to rotational energy.

13. Transformation
    To convert a flow (material, energy, signal) from one form to another.
    Example: An electrical motor transforms electrical energy into rotational energy.

F. Provision

15. Supply
    To provide a flow from storage.
    Example: In a flashlight, the battery supplies energy to the bulb.

G. Signal
To provide information on a material, energy, or signal flow as an output signal flow.
The information providing flow passes through the function unchanged.

16. Sense
    To perceive, or become aware, of a flow.
    Example: An audiocassette machine senses if the end of the tape has been reached.

    i. Detect
    To discover information about a flow.
    Example: A gauge on the top of a gas cylinder detects proper pressure ranges.

    ii. Measure
    To determine the magnitude of a flow.
    Example: An analog thermostat measures temperature through a bimetallic strip.

17. Indicate
    To make something known to the user about a flow.
    Example: A small window in the water container of a coffee maker indicates the level of water in the machine.

    i. Track
    To observe and record data from a flow.
    Example: By tracking the performance of batteries, the low efficiency point can be determined.

    ii. Display

18. Process
    To submit information to a particular treatment or method having a set number of operations or steps.
    Example: A computer processes a login request signal before allowing a user access to its facilities.

H. Support
To firmly fix a material into a defined location, or secure an energy or signal into a specific course.

19. Stabilize
    To prevent a flow from changing course or location.
    Example: On a typical canister vacuum, the center of gravity is placed at a low elevation to stabilize the vacuum when it is pulled by the hose.
