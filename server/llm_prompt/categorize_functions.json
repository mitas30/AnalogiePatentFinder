Branch\nTo cause a flow (material, energy, signal) to no longer be joined or mixed.\n\n1. Separate\n To isolate a flow (material, energy, signal) into distinct components.\n The separated components are distinct from the flow before separation, as well as each other.\n Example: A glass prism separates light into different wavelength components to produce a rainbow.\n\n2. Divide\n To separate a flow.\n Example: A vending machine divides the solid form of coins into appropriate denominations.\n\n3. Extract\n To draw, or forcibly pull out, a flow.\n Example: A vacuum cleaner extracts debris from the imported mixture and exports clean air to the environment.\n\n4. Remove\n To take away a part of a flow from its prefixed place.\n Example: A sander removes small pieces of the wood surface to smooth the wood.\n\n5. Distribute\n To cause a flow (material, energy, signal) to break up.\n The individual bits are similar to each other and the undistributed flow.\n Example: An atomizer distributes (or sprays) hair-styling liquids over the head to hold the hair in the desired style.\n\nB. Channel\nTo cause a flow (material, energy, signal) to move from one location to another location.\n\n6. Import\n To bring in a flow (material, energy, signal) from outside the system boundary.\n Example: A physical opening at the top of a blender pitcher imports a solid (food) into the system. Also, a handle on the blender pitcher imports a human hand.\n\n7. Export\n To send a flow (material, energy, signal) outside the system boundary.\n Example: Pouring blended food out of a standard blender pitcher exports liquid from the system. The opening at the top of the blender is a solution to the export sub-function.\n\n8. Transfer\n To shift, or convey, a flow (material, energy, signal) from one place to another.\n\n9.

Guide\n To direct the course of a flow (material, energy, signal) along a specific path.\n Example: A domestic HVAC system guides gas (air) around the house to the correct locations via a set of ducts.\n\n12. Translate\n To fix the movement of a flow by a device into one linear direction.\n Example: In an assembly line, a conveyor belt translates partially completed products from one assembly station to another.\n\n13. Rotate\n To fix the movement of a flow by a device around one axis.\n Example: A computer disk drive rotates the magnetic disks around an axis so that the head can read data.\n\n14. Allow degree of freedom (DOF)\n To control the movement of a flow by a force external to the device into one or more directions.\n Example: To provide easy trunk access and close appropriately, trunk lids need to move along a specific degree of freedom. A four-bar linkage allows a rotational DOF for the trunk lid.\n\nC. Connect\nTo bring two or more flows (material, energy, signal) together.\n\n15. Couple\n To join or bring together flows (material, energy, signal) such that the members are still distinguishable from each other.\n Example: A standard pencil couples an eraser and a writing shaft. The coupling is performed using a metal sleeve that is crimped to the eraser and the shaft.\n\n16. Join\n To couple flows together in a predetermined manner.\n Example: A ratchet joins a socket on its square shaft interface.\n\n17. Link\n To couple flows together by means of an intermediary flow.\n Example: A turnbuckle links two ends of a steering cable together.\n\n18. Mix\n To combine two flows (material, energy, signal) into a single, uniform homogeneous mass.\n Example: A shaker mixes a paint base and its dyes to form a homogeneous liquid.\n\nD. Control magnitude\nTo alter or govern the size or amplitude of a flow (material, energy, signal).\n\n19. Actuate\n To commence the flow of energy, signal, or material in response to an imported control signal.\n Example: A circuit switch actuates the flow of electrical energy and turns on a light bulb.\n\n20. Regulate\n To adjust the flow of energy, signal, or material in response to a control signal, such as a characteristic of a flow.\n Example: Turning the valves regulates the flow rate of the liquid flowing from a faucet.\n\n21. Increase\n To enlarge a flow in response to a control signal.\n Example: Opening the valve of a faucet further increases the flow of water.\n\n22. Decrease\n To reduce a flow in response to a control signal.\n Example: Closing the valve further decreases the flow of propane to the gas grill.\n\n23. Change\n To adjust the flow of energy, signal, or material in a predetermined and fixed manner.\n Example: In a hand-held drill, a variable resistor changes the electrical energy flow to the motor, thus changing the speed at which the drill turns.\n\n24. Increment\n To enlarge a flow in a predetermined and fixed manner.\n Example: A magnifying glass increments the visual signal (i.e., the print) from a paper document.\n\n25. Decrement\n To reduce a flow in a predetermined and fixed manner.\n Example: The gear train of a power screwdriver decrements the flow of rotational energy.\n\n26. Shape\n To mold or form a flow.\n Example: In the auto industry, large presses shape sheet metal into contoured surfaces that become fenders, hoods, and trunks.\n\n27. Condition\n To render a flow appropriate for the desired use.\n Example: To prevent damage to electrical equipment, a surge protector conditions electrical energy by excluding spikes and noise (usually through capacitors) from the energy path.\n\n28. Stop\n To cease, or prevent, the transfer of a flow (material, energy, signal).\n Example: A reflective coating on a window stops the transmission of UV radiation through a window.\n\n29. Prevent\n To keep a flow from happening.\n Example: A submerged gate on a dam wall prevents water from flowing to the other side.\n\n30.
